    { title: "The Rainbow", author: "Christina Rossetti", text: "Boats sail on the rivers, and ships sail on the seas. But clouds that sail across the sky are prettier than these.

    { title: "The Sunshine", author: "Anonymous", text: "The sun is shining brightly, up in the sky so blue. It wakes the flowers and trees, and all the children too. The birds begin to sing their songs, the bees begin to buzz. Oh what a happy morning, for all of us it was!" },

    { title: "My Shadow", author: "Robert Louis Stevenson", text: "I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me, and what can be the use of him is more than I can see. He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head, and I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed." },

    { title: "The Little Star", content: "Once upon a time, there was a tiny little star who lived high up in the night sky. While all the other stars were big and bright, this little star felt small and dim. One night, a little girl looked up and said, 'Mommy, look at that tiny star! It's my favorite because it's special and unique, just like me!' The little star glowed with happiness, realizing that being different made him special. From that day on, he shone with confidence, knowing that someone loved him just the way he was." },
    { title: "The Brave Little Ant", content: "In a tiny ant colony, there lived a small ant named Andy. While other ants were afraid to cross the big puddle after rain, Andy was brave.

The queen made Andy the Royal Knight, and all the ants learned that courage comes in all sizes!" },

  books: [
    { title: "Alice in Wonderland - Chapter 1 Excerpt", author: "Lewis Carroll", excerpt: "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'without pictures or conversations?' So she was considering in her own mind whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her." },
    { title: "The Little Prince - Chapter 1", author: "Antoine de Saint-Exupéry", excerpt: "Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. In the book it said: 'Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.' I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle." },
    { title: "Peter Pan - Chapter 1", author: "J.M. Barrie", excerpt: "All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, 'Oh, why can't you remain like this forever!' This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up." },
    { title: "Charlotte's Web - Excerpt", author: "E.B. White", excerpt: "'Where's Papa going with that ax?' said Fern to her mother as they were setting the table for breakfast. 'Out to the hoghouse,' replied Mrs. Arable. 'Some pigs were born last night.' 'I don't see why he needs an ax,' continued Fern, who was only eight. 'Well,' said her mother, 'one of the pigs is a runt. It's very small and weak, and it will never amount to anything. So your father has decided to do away with it.'" },
    { title: "The Secret Garden - Chapter 1", author: "Frances Hodgson Burnett", excerpt: "When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle, everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen. It was true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another." },
    { title: "Anne of Green Gables - Chapter 1", author: "L.M. Montgomery", excerpt: "Mrs. Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies' eardrops and traversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the old Cuthbert place. It was bounded on one side by the road, on the other by a hedge of gigantic spruce. Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window, knitting, when she saw something that made her drop her knitting and stare in amazement." },
    { title: "The Wizard of Oz - Chapter 1", author: "L. Frank Baum", excerpt: "Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds." },
    { title: "Winnie the Pooh - Chapter 1", author: "A.A. Milne", excerpt: "Here is Edward Bear, coming downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there really is another way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there isn't." }
